# MyVeryFirstUnfinishedAndTerribleTaskVersion2

This is the second version since I want to practice pushing this

This README describes a project which is still incomplete and seemed awfully confusing at the beginning but now is only terribly confusing; but it is fun, even though I am definitely drowning here.

Let's see if I can attach an image to this baby.

I linked a file in the readme that was created on my PC after pulling from gitlab but I can get everyhting but the read me to update and trying to add the file here, I just get a 404 error since it is hosted on my machine I guess. I'll figure it out sometime.
